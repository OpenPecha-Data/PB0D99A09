The Summoning Hook of Wish-Fulfilment: An Appeal for Prosperity
by Könchok Tenpe Drönme (1762–1823)

chöying ngang lé drekpé kur shyeng té
Arising in a ferocious form out of the state of dharmadhātu,
chö shyin drubpa kün dang khyepardu
To protect all who practise according to the Dharma,
chö dré chenyen drik sok sung dzepa
Especially those who teach and study in the Dharma college—
chökyong chenpo ma yel dengdir gong
Great dharmapāla, do not forsake us, but look upon us here and now!

jampal yang ngö shyepé dorjé yi
Mañjughoṣa in person, Jamyang Zhepai Dorje,1
gönné shedrub nyer du tepa shyin
Entrusted you with responsibility for this monastery and study and practice—
gendün dü tsok chenyen longchö kün
Now aid us accordingly, so that the saṅgha assembly, education and resources
yar gyi tso shyin gyepé dong drok dzö
All expand and increase like a lake in summer!

nammin yönten gyé kyi lü tsal dzok
With bodies fully strengthened by the eight ripened qualities,2
tö sam pemé tsal la gawé tsen
They joyfully enter the lotus garden of listening and reflecting,
lung rik dab ma yang nyen drokpa yi
And hum sweetly on the wings of scripture and reasoning—
kang druk drang yé duwé cha yang tsol
Grant us prosperity so that countless bee-like students gather!

khé tsün lhaksam chen gyi lobpön dang
A teacher who is learned, disciplined and altruistic in intention
dé tsön sherab denpé lobma nyi
And a student who is dedicated, diligent and intelligent—
tendrel lhenchik dzompé chenyen gyi
Through the interdependent circumstances of their coming together,
gyaltsen sitser drengpé cha yang tsol
Grant us the prosperity of raising study’s banner at the world’s very peak!

shyungdön dampar sharwé gowa dang
Understanding through which textual points become practical instructions,
tsikdön tra shyib jepa rikpé trul
The exercise of reasoning with a precise discernment of words and meaning,
ngepa kyejé gyab ten lung dangché
And the generation of certainty with the full support of scriptural citation—
tsö ngak gatön pelwé cha yang tsol
Grant us the prosperity of expanding the feast of exchanges in debate!

damchö dulwé gongdön düpé trim
The rules of the assembly are the intent of the sacred Dharma of the Vinaya,
lé dré drang tik debpé lejepa
Behaving correctly and forging a straight path between action and effect,
tsarchö jedzin ting nön mi yolwé
Without lapsing into the supplementary conduct of elimination and guidance—
cha trim mang shyi tenpö cha yang tsol
Grant us the prosperity of a stable foundation based on disciplinary codes!

ngen shé drak la chawé ukpa dang
To shine upon the owl who is stationed upon the rock of improper habit
langdor lam du gyuwé shenjepa
And so that we might discern the paths to be taken and to be avoided,
lé dré denpé nyima öpo ché
Grant us the prosperity of revealing the great light in all its splendour,
nangwa ngön du gyurwé cha yang tsol
The brilliant sun that is the reality of actions and their effects!

dik chö gyen du ngompa lokpé tam
Without flaunting unwholesome conduct, speaking erroneously,
choklhung tsam gyi ngakpé mu chor sok
Or audaciously lavishing praise based on mere bias, and the like—
mayin chö kyi drakpa chö shyindu
Grant us the prosperity of enhancing the Dharma’s reputation
drak jé nyenpé künkhyab cha yang tsol
Universally through statements that accord with the Dharma!

sönam shying gi chokgyur gendün dang
The saṅgha is the supreme field of merit,
sönam dé tong dzompa jinpé dak
And the devoted, generous patron gains merit,
sönam dik dang ma dré gyujor gyi
Through meritorious gifts, unassociated with misdeeds,
sönam dü tön darwé cha yang tsol
Grant us the prosperity of developing festivals of merit!

ngön dö tsangwé lo yi yowa lé
Not through a mind that is filled with selfish desire,
jung min shedrub tenpa né gyur na
But so that study and practice of the teachings may endure,
ngang gi duwa sungmé trinlé kyi
Spontaneously, through the activity of the guardians,
püntsok paljor gyepé cha yang tsol
Grant us the prosperity of increasing property and resources!

khyepar losal dönnyer tsul tün nam
In particular, so that those who are bright, responsible and ethical
né rim dön gek kyen gyi mi dziwar
May remain unperturbed by disease, harmful influences and adversity,
tö sam jawa delak tarchin té
And easily complete the activities related to study and reflection,
dön nyi mönpa shyindu drubpar dzö
Ensure that the twofold aim may be accomplished just as we wish!

dorna mindö nyertsé kün dangdral
In short, may we avoid all that is undesirable and harmful,
püntsok lek jé malü lhün gyi drub
May all that is magnificent be spontaneously accomplished,
gyalten norbu gyaltsen tser chöpé
And by honouring the jewel of the teachings atop the banner of victory,
nangsi gelek nangwé khyab gyur chik
May the light of virtue and excellence pervade appearance and existence!

sönam dargyé ri gyal lhünpo shyin
May merit increase and grow like Sumeru, king of mountains,
nyendrak chenpo namkha shyindu khyab
May fame and glory spread as pervasively as the sky itself,
tsering nemé shyendön lhün gyi drub
May long-life, good health and others’ welfare be spontaneously accomplished,
yönten gyatso chok gi tashi shok
And may all be auspicious so that we gain a great ocean of qualities!

Rabjampa Lobzang Palden, the dedicated and diligent caretaker of Tösam Ling requested an appeal
for prosperity related to the affairs of the monastic college, which could be recited
at the conclusion of the protectors’ practice. A general prosperity appeal for pure discipline,
as well as particular prosperity appeals for the study of the five major scriptures
in the philosophy college and the study and practice of the two stages of tantra in the mantra
college are recitations, and it is difficult for the invited guests to act in accordance
with these requests, but I thought it would still be beneficial to invoke the wisdom-minds
of the guardians as a condition for the accomplishment of each particular aim. Thus,
this was written by the monk Könchok Tenpai Drönme.
