An Appeal for the Prosperity of Teaching and Studying the Five Major Scriptures
by Pari Lobzang Rabsal

hung lama yidam yermé könchok sum
Hūṃ. Guru and yidam deity inseparable, Three Jewels,
pawo khandro tensung tsok nam kyi
Warrior deities, ḍākinīs, and hosts of dharma guardians—
lhündrub trinlé trinchen trikpa lé
Through the amassing of great clouds of spontaneous activity,
shé dang drubpé gelek jin pob shik
Let fall the virtuous and excellent blessings of study and practice!

jampal yang ngö tsongkha pé
Just as Tsongkhapa, who was Mañjughoṣa in person,
gönné shedrub tuk kyi gongpa shyin
Directed his wisdom to the monastery and study and practice—
gendün dü tsok chenyen püntsok kün
Now let the resources for the education of the saṅgha
yar gyi chuter jishyin pelwar dzö
Expand and increase like a lake in summertime!

nammin yönten gyé kyi lü tsal dzok
With bodies fully strengthened by the eight ripened qualities,1
tö sam pemé tsal la gawé tsen
They joyfully enter the lotus garden of listening and reflecting,
lung rik dabma yang nyen drokpa yi
And hum sweetly on the wings of scripture and reasoning—
kang druk drang yé duwé cha yang tsol
Grant us prosperity so that countless bee-like students gather!

khé tsün lhaksam chen gyi lobpön dang
A teacher who is learned, disciplined and altruistic in intention
dé tsön sherab denpé lobma nyi
And a student who is dedicated, diligent and intelligent—
tendrel lhenchik dzompé chenyen gyi
Through the interdependent circumstances of their coming together,
gyaltsen sitser drengpé cha yang tsol
Grant us the prosperity of raising study’s banner at the world’s very peak!

shyungdön dampar sharwé gowa dang
Understanding through which textual points become practical instructions,
tsikdön trashyib jepa rikpé trul
The exercise of reasoning with a precise discernment of words and meaning,
ngepa kyejé gyab ten lung dang ché
And the generation of certainty with the full support of scriptural citation—
tsö ngak gatön pelwé cha yang tsol
Grant us the prosperity of expanding the feast of exchanges in debate!

damchö gongdön tsulshyin düpé trim
Monastic rules include the fundamental intent of the sacred Dharma,
lé dré drang tik debpé lejepa
Behaving correctly and forging a straight path between action and effect,
tsarchö jedzin ting nön mi yolwé
Without lapsing into the supplementary conduct of elimination and guidance—
cha trim mang shyi tenpö cha yang tsol
Grant us the prosperity of a stable foundation based on disciplinary codes!

ngen shé drak la chawé ukpa dang
To shine upon the owl who is stationed upon the rock of improper habit
langdor lam du gyuwé shenjepa
And so that we might discern the paths to be taken and to be avoided,
lé dré denpé nyima öpo ché
Grant us the prosperity of revealing the great light in all its splendour,
nangwa ngön du gyurwé cha yang tsol
The brilliant sun that is the reality of actions and their effects!

dik chö gyen du ngompa lokpé tam
Without flaunting unwholesome conduct, speaking erroneously,
chok lhung tsam gyi ngakpé mu chor sok
Or audaciously lavishing praise based on mere bias, and the like—
mayin chö kyi drakpa chö shyindu
Grant us the prosperity of enhancing the Dharma’s reputation
drak jé nyenpé künkhyab cha yang tsol
Universally through statements that accord with the Dharma!

sönam shying gi chokgyur gendün dang
The saṅgha is the supreme field of merit,
sönam dé tong dzompa jinpé dak
And the devoted, generous patron gains merit,
sönam dik dang ma dré gyujor gyi
Through meritorious gifts, unassociated with misdeeds,
sönam dü tön darwé cha yang tsol
Grant us the prosperity of developing festivals of merit!

ngön dö tsangwé lo yi yowa lé
Not through a mind that is filled with selfish desire,
jung min shedrub tenpa né gyur na
But so that study and practice of the teachings may endure,
ngang gi duwa sungmé trinlé kyi
Spontaneously, through the activity of the guardians,
püntsok paljor gyepé cha yang tsol
Grant us the prosperity of increasing property and resources!

khyepar losal dönnyer tsul tün nam
In particular, so that those who are bright, responsible and ethical
né rim dön gek kyen gyi mi dziwar
May remain unperturbed by disease, harmful influences and adversity,
tö sam jawa delak tarchin té
And easily complete the activities related to study and reflection,
dön nyi mönpa shyindu drubpar dzö
Ensure that the twofold aim may be accomplished just as we wish!

dorna mindö nyertsé kün dang dral
In short, may we avoid all that is undesirable and harmful,
püntsok lek jé malü lhün gyi drub
May all that is magnificent be spontaneously accomplished,
gyalten norbu gyaltsen tser chöpé
And by honouring the jewel of the teachings atop the banner of victory,
nangsi gelek nangwé khyab gyur chik
May the light of virtue and excellence pervade appearance and existence!

sönam dargyé ri gyal lhünpo shyin
May merit increase and grow like Sumeru, king of mountains,
nyendrak chenpo namkha shyindu khyab
May fame and glory spread as pervasively as the sky itself,
tsering nemé shyendön lhün gyi drub
May long-life, good health and others’ welfare be spontaneously accomplished,
yönten gyatso chok gi tashi shok
And may all be auspicious so that we gain a great ocean of qualities!

Slightly adapted from the Nechung prosperity rite composed by the venerable Gungthangpa Tenpai
Drönme,2 this is just as the guru practised it, in connection with the homage and offering
to the Six Ornaments.
